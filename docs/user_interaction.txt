When the user comes to the site, he sees a list of contracts with cancellation 
dates in the next 60 days. They are color coded, with the near ones being red, 
farther out orange, and the others green.

The user may filter the list by

- Company
- Signing date range (start date + duration)
- Expiration date range
- Cancellation date range
- A location
- Z location

Links let you edit the contract, delete the contract, make a new contract using this information.

Follow a link to a page which lets you add a new contract.

Follow the link to a settings page which provides links to subpages for 
changing currency, location, company, and so on.

Main page leads to 
- New contract page. New contract page leads back to main page.
- Settings page

Setting page leads to
- Currency settings
- Location settings
- Company settings

Subpages provide a list of that element. Usual CRUD operations. 
Navigation lets you go to contract or settings.
