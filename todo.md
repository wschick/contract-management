Current status: Everything around contracts works, now I need to get contracts themselves working

To do:

* In filter form, get filtering by status working
* Get daily alerts working.
* Add contract type field.
* Get file uploads working
* Finish contract filtering. On form submission, grab data, generate where clause and display. How to persist it? Cookie?
* Add filtering to contracts table. Filter by status, company location.
* Add sorting to contracts table. Sort by contract name, contract id, mcr, locations, cancel in
* Add paging to contracts table
* Handle text area too big on descriptions. Better form validation.
* Date picker?
