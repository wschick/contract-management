Current status: Everything around contracts works, now I need to get contracts themselves working

To do:

* Get contract editing working.
* Get file uploads working
* Add sorting to contracts table. Sort by contract name, contract id, mcr, locations, cancel in
* Add filtering to contracts table. Filter by status, company location.
* Get reminder-contact table working.
* Get daily alerts working.
* Add paging to contracts table
* Add "sent" to reminder so I won't sent it again.
* Date picker?
