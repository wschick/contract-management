Current status: Everything around contracts works, now I need to get contracts themselves working

To do:

* In filter form, get filtering by status working
* Mark required fields consistently, and use a star or some color
* Finish contract filtering. On form submission, grab data, generate where clause and display. How to persist it? Cookie?
* Get daily alerts working.
* Add paging to contracts table
* Handle text area too big on descriptions. Better form validation.
* Date picker?
* Consider using either Int or BigDecimal for the mrc and nrc. If there is never a fractional part, just use Int.
